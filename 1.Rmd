This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)

data1 <- read.table(file ="output/combined_gapMinder.tsv",header= TRUE)

data2 <- subset(data1, country == "China")
data3 <- subset(data1, country =="Austria")
data4 <- subset(data1, country =="Belgium")
plot( data2$year, data2$gdpPercap, type="l", col="red", xlab="year",ylab="GDP",main="GDP", yaxt='n')
points(data2$year, data2$gdpPercap, pch =15, col = "red")
par(new=TRUE)
plot( data2$year, data3$gdpPercap, type="l", col="green",xlab="",ylab="", yaxt='n')
 points(data2$year, data3$gdpPercap, pch =17, col = "green")
 par(new=TRUE)
plot( data2$year, data4$gdpPercap, type="l", col="blue",xlab="",ylab="")
 points(data2$year, data3$gdpPercap, pch =19, col = "blue")
 
legend( x="topleft", 
        legend=c("China","Austria","Belgium"),
        col=c("red","green","blue"), pch=15ï¼Œ17,19, lwd=2,  lty=c(1,2,3))


```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
